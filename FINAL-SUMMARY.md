## 🔄 Next Steps

### For Additional Nodes
```bash
# When steve-ideapad connectivity is restored
./scripts/auto-cluster-setup.sh --node 192.168.4.157

# Add any new nodes
./scripts/quick-cluster-deploy.sh 192.168.5.57 <new-node-ip>
```

### For Production Use
```bash
# Set up monitoring cron job
echo "0 */6 * * * $(pwd)/scripts/health-check.sh" | crontab -

# Regular cluster demo/testing
./scripts/demo-cluster.sh

# Scale cluster as needed
./scripts/auto-cluster-setup.sh --node <additional-ips>
```

## 🏆 Project Achievements
