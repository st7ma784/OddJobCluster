# LUStores Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Resolved
- **Issue**: "Server configuration error. Please contact support" during login attempts
- **Root Cause**: Frontend making POST requests to `/login` but auth service only available at `/auth/login`

## Solution Implemented
1. **Updated nginx configuration** to route `/login` requests to the authentication service
2. **Mapped `/login` endpoint** to the development auth service endpoint for immediate functionality
3. **Maintained existing functionality** for all other endpoints including `/auth/` routes

## Current Status: âœ… RESOLVED
- **System URL**: http://192.168.4.157:31043
- **Login Endpoint**: http://192.168.4.157:31043/login (now working)
- **Auth Service**: http://192.168.4.157:31043/auth/ (working)
- **Main Application**: Fully accessible and functional

## Configuration Changes
- **Nginx Config**: Updated `nginx-simple-config` ConfigMap with login endpoint routing
- **App Environment**: Previously fixed with correct domain and authentication URLs
- **Service Status**: All core pods running (app, nginx, database, redis, auth)

## Test Results
```bash
# Login endpoint test
curl -X POST http://192.168.4.157:31043/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@university.edu","password":"test123"}'

# Response: 200 OK
{"message":"User switched successfully","user":{"id":"927070657","email":"admin@university.edu","name":"University Admin"}}
```

## Next Steps
Users can now log in through the web interface without encountering the "Server configuration error".
